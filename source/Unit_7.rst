Firewalls
---------

Firewalls can be physical hardware devices, or simply software. Firewalls filter traffic based on rules. Filtering as far as firewalls are concerned means that certain packets are not let into a network.
It also means that packets on the way out of a network can be blocked from leaving. Certain packets will not be filtered. **Firewalls permit or deny traffic both inbound and outbound.**

Firewalls can filter by source IP address, destination IP addresses, protocols, ports, and other criteria.

* Hardware based firewalls are also referred to as network based firewalls.
* Software based firewalls are also known as host based firewalls.
